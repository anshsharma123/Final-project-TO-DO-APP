REFLECTIVE PAPER 

I created an advanced Todo App that enables users to manage their tasks efficiently. The app includes features such as adding tasks with details 
(like due date and priority), searching for tasks, sorting them based on various criteria, and tracking progress with a dynamic progress bar. 
It also has a dark mode for a better user experience and saves tasks using local storage, so data even after refreshing the page.
My apporach is to design the user interface(ui) using HTML and CSS it is clean and user frieldly. I applied the app functional step by step using Javascript to manage the task, update progress and theme toggling.
In this Todo App i have added 5 features that are (Sort Tasks, Priority Levels, Search/Filter, Progress Tracker and Theme Toggle.)


The challanges i faced while making this Todo App and how i Overcame it i faced problem like Data persistence, Sorting and Filtering, Progress Bar Accuracy, Dark Mode.

The things that i learned while making the  Todo App was JavaScript Fundamentals (My understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and array methods like FILTER and SORT.)
Local Storage (This project taught me how to use local storage effictively to save and retrieve data, which is valuable for building web application.
CSS Variables and THemes (Hoe to use CSS variables to create a flexible design system, making it easier to implement themes like dark mode.

Feedback and Ideas

The app works well there is always room for improvement. For example, adding categories for tasks could make the app more organized. Integrating a notification system to remind users of overdue tasks could enhance usability. Using a backend database insted of local storage would allow users to acess their tasks across multiple devices.

Overall, this project was a great learning experience, and excited to enhance it further in future and get the feedback and suggestions of the users and theri experience.
